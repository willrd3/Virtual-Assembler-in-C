# Virtual-Assembler-in-C

 I built an assembler for x86 assembly language that ran various commands and functions. 
 
 Some of the commands are move into variable, move the memory locations, comparison using flags, jumps, getting an input, moving to a new memory location to perform a function, and returning back to the original code. 
 
 The assembly code that I provided passes in a number by reference to a memory location and jumps to the function call which checks if the number is in the range of 0-100 (inclusive) and puts the number into a new memory location. 
 
 This isn't the most efficient code as I had no prior knowledge of C or C++ before taking the class and had to learn the language on the fly.
